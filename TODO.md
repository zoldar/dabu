# TODO

* [x] make collision detection work for smaller and entity offset shapes
* [x] generalize collision detection
* [x] generalize entity behavior
* [x] introduce scene abstraction for easier rendering
* [x] try implementing basics of boomerman as a test
* [ ] collision layers for hits and collisions (collisions, mostly), when finally needed

For later:

* [ ] add sounds
* [ ] add text rendering
* [ ] convenience for menus (implemented as a separate scene, scene switching will be needed)
* [ ] leaderboard?
